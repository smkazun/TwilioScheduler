# TwilioScheduler
A scheduler that sends out a birthday message to users at the beginning of the month. This was a fun coding challenge I did around March 2020, though it is lacking unit tests at the moment.

To use this application you must have the following:

1. A Twilio account (Must replace SID and AUTH_TOKEN in code)
2. Add the Quartz scheduling libary to the project (http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/)
3. Add Apache POI to the project (https://poi.apache.org/ and https://poi.apache.org/components/spreadsheet/quick-guide.html)
